# Introduction

Welcome to CoinGecko’s very first book, **How to DeFi**! DeFi is the acronym for the term Decentralized Finance and is currently one of the fastest-growing sectors in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. DeFi has grown very rapidly in the past one year but materials to help people grasp the idea of DeFi lagged behind. We set out on our research in this exciting new space and condensed all of our findings into the 1st Edition of this book here.

DeFi is an ecosystem of Decentralized Applications (Dapps) that provide financial services built on top of distributed networks with no governing authority. A majority of the DeFi Dapps currently being built are on the Ethereum blockchain, so for purposes of brevity, this will be the focus in this book.

DeFi has been the key theme in Ethereum’s development in 2019 and 2020. At this point of writing, DeFi Dapps have locked up over $1 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. DeFi is expected to grow further in the coming years and is a key component in fulfilling Ethereum’s lofty vision and ambition.

How to DeFi

In this book, we will be explaining what DeFi is and how it is important for the community. We will be looking at the various elements of DeFi such as decentralized stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, decentralized lending, decentralized derivatives, and decentralized insurance. In each of these chapters, we will be providing step-by-step guides to assist you to interact with at least one of the DeFi products.

Throughout the book, we will have Recommended Readings at the end of each chapter. In these sections, we will share supplementary reading materials that we believe will be useful as you dive deeper into the DeFi ecosystem - all credits of course go to their respective authors. Kudos to them for making DeFi more accessible!

This book is aimed at DeFi beginners so if you are a DeFi expert, do kindly share with us how we can further improve it to make DeFi friendlier for other beginners in our future editions. To accelerate the DeFi adoption, we want to make the complex designs of DeFi simple for the public to understand and accessible for them to get started.

We hope that by sharing our learnings with you, we will help you get up to speed with DeFi and are able to join us to participate in this movement.
